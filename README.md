## Concept 

This is an implementation of the board game Legends of Andor  made with Phaser 3 + Typescript, that runs in the browser.
It features concurrent multiplayer game sessions (on computers connected to the same network),
chat, and the possibility to save and load games. The rules are full-fledged for legend 2.
