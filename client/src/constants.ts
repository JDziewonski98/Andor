`A gloomy mood has fallen upon the people. Rumors are making 
the rounds that skrals have set up a stronghold in some 
undiscovered location. The heroes have scattered themselves 
across the entire land in search of this location. 
The defense of the castle is in their hands alone.

Many farmers have asked for help and are seeking shelter 
behind the high walls of Rietburg Castle`,

// A4, story1
`At first sunlight, the heroes receive a message: 
Old King Brandmur's willpower seems to have weakened with the 
passage of time. But there is said to be a herb growing in 
the mountain passes that can revive a person's life.

Task:
The heroes must heal the king with the medicinal herb. To do 
that, they must find the witch. Only she know the locations 
where this herb grows.
The witch is hiding behind one of the fog tokens.`,

// A5, story2
`From now on, any articles (in addition to strength points)
may be purchased from the merchants (spaces 18, 57, and 71)
for 2 gold each.
Each hero starts with 2 strength points. The group receives
5 gold and 2 wineskins, how to divide them is up to you.
Best of luck, Andor depends on you!`,

// C1, story3
`The king's scouts have discovered the skral stronghold in 
the North.

Task:
The stronghold must be defeated. When it is defeated, the
Narrator is advanced to the letter "N" on the Legend track.

There is more unsettling news. Rumors are circulating about 
cruel wardraks from the south. They have not yet been sighted, 
but more and more farmers are losing their courage, leaving
their farmsteads, and seeking safety in the castle.`,

// C2, story4
`But there's good news from the south too: Prince Thorald,
just back from a battle on the edge of the southern forest,
is preparing himself to help the heroes.

The prince contributes 3 extra strength points for the heroes
in battle if he is standing on the same space as the creature.
Instead of fighting or moving, a hero can now also choose to
move the prince during their move. This costs 1 hour, and the
prince can be moved up to 4 spaces. After moving the prince,
it is the next hero's turn
Prince Thorald will accompany you until G on the Legend track.`,

// Legend Goal (C2), story5
`Legend Goal:
The Legend is won when the Narrator reaches N on the Legend
track, and:
    The castle has been defended.
    The medicinal herb is on the castle space.
    The stronghold has been defeated.`,

// Runestones, story6
`The heroes learn about an ancient magic that still holds
power: rune stones!
The rune stones can be uncovered with a telescope, or when
standing on the same space. If a hero holds 3 different
coloured rune stones, they get one black die, which is
stronger than the hero dice. As long as they hold the rune
stones, they can use this black die in battle instead of 
their regular dice.`,

// G, story7
`Prince Thorald joins up with a scouting patrol with the 
intention of leaving for just a few days. But he is not to
be seen again for quite a long time.

Black shadows are moving in the moonlight. The rumors were
right - the wardraks are coming!
Wardraks are powerful creatures that move twice each sunrise,
but also yield a handsome reward of 6 gold or 6 willpower.`,

// Witch revealed, story8
`Finally! There in the fog, one of the heroes discovers the
witch named Reka. Reka prepares a special brew and hands one
to the hero who found her.
Any hero on the same space as the witch can buy a brew; the 
archer pays 1 less coin. In a battle, the brew doubles the
value of 1 die. One brew can be used twice.

Reka knows where to find the medicinal herb to heal the king. 
But a Gor has obtained it! The Gor must be defeated to pick
up the herb.`,

// N (win game), story9
`With their combined powers, the heroes were able to defeat 
the Skral's Stronghold. 

The medicinal herb did its work as well, and King Brandur soon 
felt better.

And yet, the heroes still felt troubled. The king's son, 
Prince Thorald, had not yet returned. What was keeping him so 
long? In the next Legend, you will find out.

Congratulations. You won!!`,

// N (lose game), story10
`You lost.

Tips for next time:
+ Articles such as the falcon and telescope can be very helpful.
+ Prince Thorald's extra strength can help in a battle against 
  Skrals.
+ It's very important to find the witch quickly.
+ To save time, it is sometimes better for one hero to get the 
  entire reward in gold. Then just one hero has to get to the 
  merchant`
