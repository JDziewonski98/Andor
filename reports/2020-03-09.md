### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Async socket calls and responses in client server can be unpredictable
 * JS code can be difficult to follow for client server communication as the 'action' happens in many different files
 * Often when tackling one task/issue, other things come to the surface that must be implemented/refactored beforehand


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Everyone needs to be working on this every day.
 * We need to make sure everyone is assigned a task and pressure them to complete it on time.
 * Async server calls are not always as fast as we'd like them to be / do not always execute in desired order.
