### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Coordinating times to meet to make sure we are all on the same page about the models.
 * Some group members fell sick, working around that was a challenge.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 *  We learned to have more frequent meetings when doing something that requires that something else be complete, like the models.
